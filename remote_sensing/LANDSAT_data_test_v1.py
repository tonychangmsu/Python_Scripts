Title: 		LANDSAT_data_test.py
Date: 		Created 2016.02.03

Author: 	Tony Chang
Abstract: 	Tests the LANDSAT_tools.py library to observe how the data structure can be manipulated and processed using the enhanced wetness difference index defined as the difference in tasseled wap wetness for two or more dates to detect red-attack stands of lodgepole pine. A decrease in TCWet over time (negative EWDI value) is the best overall indicator of conifer mortality (Collins and Woodcock 1996) 

Should note that this data is already calculated as surface reflectance?

TC_wet = 0.2626*B1+0.2141*B2+0.0926*B3+0.0656*B4-0.7629*B5-0.5388*B7

defined by Huang et al 2002 use landsat images from 1999-2008 for path 38, row 29 to represent core of GYE WBP. Late summer and early fall (ranging from Aug. 9 to Oct. 6) images were chosen to minimize the effects of snow, snowmelt, and understory green-up on TCWet. All images were geometrically registered to a base Landsat image (Sept. 15,1999 ETM+) to within 0.5-pixel root mean squared error since fires were also a problem in detection of disturbance they were filtered out of the analysis. Perimeters of wildfires in the study area were obtained from three sources: US Forest Service Region 1 Fire History Layer (Smail and Tanke 2008), Yellowstone National Park Fire History Layer (Spatial Analysis Center 2005), and the federal Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools Project (LANDFIRE) Rapid Refresh product, which is derived from MODIS satellite imagery (LANDFIRE 2007). These three fire history data sets were rasterized to 30-m pixels and combined so that a fire recorded in any layer resulted in a fire in the combined raster. Fire perimeters were separately calculated for each individual year, 1999â€“2008. Cumulative fire history masks were created for each year of imagery (i.e., the 2005 fire mask included fires from 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005, whereas the 2004 mask did not include 2005 fires).
