Landsat notes:

In order to complete the landsat analysis, I've decided to log what I have done in order to have
documentation of the process required. 

1) enter Earth Explorer and gather all the scenes that we require for our change analysis http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/

2) Following the Zhu and Woodcock methods, we select all scenes from 1984-2011 for landsat 5 ToA and BT, that has been
corrected for atmospheric effects. 

3) 	a)In the search criteria tab, select a date range (1-1-85, 11-30-11)
	b)In Data Sets, go to the Landsat Archive tab and select L4-5 (info at https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/TM)
	c)Additional criteria, set WRS path to 37 to 39, WRS row to 28 to 30 
	d)Set cloud cover all?, ideally get L1T which is the highest level: http://landsat.usgs.gov/Landsat_Processing_Details.php
	e)This should return some 3579 results...
	f)We can then return and change cloud cover to less than 80% (based on Fmask results), which gives us 3496 results.
		note) I used 1997-2011 to get 845 files

4) Now export the results to a txt file (make sure you are logged in), and return non-limited results as csv
	a) note, one needs to remove all the associated data and just request the name of the scene, rather than
		the entire metadata file

5) Go to the ESPA processing system from USGS, to obtained Level-1 products: http://espa.cr.usgs.gov/ordering/new

6) 	a) Choose source products as input products and input product metadata
	b) get the TOA, BT, CFMask, and surface reflectance
	c) get all the indices
	d) Customize to get HDF files, if necessary.
	e) submit and wait for order to come in, should receive an email.

7)	Now go to the site and copy the html source to get all the download urls (a href tags)

8)	Once the html is parsed, use script to iterate over all the download url lists.

9)	Once data is unzipped, the first technical steps can occur.

Land cover reference

1) 	I need to identify a land cover reference data to calibrate the data. I intend to use the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). from 1992, 2000, 2006, and 2011. 

2)	NLCD needs to be clipped to our study area.

3)	Use fmask to identify cloud and cloud shadows
